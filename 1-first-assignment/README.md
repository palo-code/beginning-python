# First Assignment

This assignment is an easy one just to get you into the groove of submitting assignments this way.  If you follow these instructions exactly, everything should be ok.

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.  If using the command line, type `git clone` and then the link to your repository.  For example: `git clone https://github.com/palo-code/first-assignment-rpalo`
2. We'll be using the branching workflow.  Create a new branch called "beginning-assignment".  If you are using a terminal, type `git checkout -b beginning-assignment`.
3. Fill in the main function in `first.py`.  Follow the instructions provided there.
4. Ensure the tests provided pass.  Test via the command line like so: `pytest`.
5. Once everything passes, you should have at least one commit on your new branch.  Make sure that is the case.
6. Update the project README with a description of the project, usage information, etc.  For this assignment, just give a blurb about what it does.
7. Once the test(s) pass and you have documentation, create a new pull request to pull your "beginning-assignment" branch into your master branch.  Be sure to have @rpalo in the body of the pull request.  I will review, and if everything looks good, I'll merge and score the assignment!  If you're having problems, feel free to create the pull request early, and comment (mentioning @rpalo so I get notified) and we'll go over it.
